### Take a deep look at the dataset and Pandas series we are working with

# Import the Pandas library
import pandas as pd

# Read in the data from the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('leadersdata.csv')
data

data.columns

# Setting Player's Name as the index
data.set_index('Player', inplace=True)

# Creating pandas series for each column
innings = data['I']
runs = data['R']
balls = data['B']
outs = data['Outs']
batting_average = data['Avg']
strike_rate = data['SR']
highest_score = data['HS']
number_of_fours = data['4s']
number_of_sixes = data['6s']
number_of_fifties = data['50']
number_of_hundreds = data['100']


# Printing the first 5 rows of each series
print("Innings:\n", innings.head())
print("Runs:\n", runs.head())
print("Balls:\n", balls.head())
print("Outs:\n", outs.head())
print("Batting Average:\n", batting_average.head())
print("Strike Rate:\n", strike_rate.head())
print("Highest Score:\n", highest_score.head())
